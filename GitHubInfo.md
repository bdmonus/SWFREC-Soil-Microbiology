# GitHub Info
(I use GitKraken because that is what I have used in the past, feel free to use whatever interface you are comfortable with and I can do my best to help you)
1. Download GitKraken (https://www.gitkraken.com/download)
2. Log in to GitKraken with your GitHub account 
3. From lab repository click the green *Code* button and copy the URL in the box (https://github.com/slstrauss/SWFREC-Soil-Microbiology.git). 
4. In GitKraken click the folder icon in the top let corner. Click *Clone* and select *Clone with URL*. There will be two dialog boxes: *Where to clone* and *URL*. Decide where on your device you want GitKraken to place the directory. Paste the URL copied from step 3 into *URL*. *Full Path* is the full path on your computer once you have cloned it. Click *Clone the repo!*
a. Cloning copies the directory and its contents to your computer as well as establishes a link between the GitHub repository and your computer
5. You should see a banner in GitKraken saying *Successfully cloned repo* if cloning worked. 
6. You can select *Open now* to view the repository in GitKraken. You can access it and any other repositories you have cloned by clicking the folder icon > Open > Open a Repository and navigating to your cloned directory. 
7. After this, you likely won’t interact with GitKraken except to commit, push, and pull from the GitHub repository. 

## Commit
Saving new files and editing existing files to the directory on your computer will be detected by GitKraken. This allows you to stage and commit them (i.e. save a snapshot of the current state of the project). To commit anything, you are required to add a comment in the *Commit Message* area. This is helpful for version control, so you and others know what is different between different versions. This will appear next to the filename on GitHub. This does not need to be detailed, just short but meaningful. Then click *Commit changes to file*. 
Committing does not put the changes on the GitHub repository. 
To get these files/changes to the repository, you need to perform a PUSH. Select file in GitKraken and click *Push* at top of screen. You will get a banner on the bottom left saying *Pushed successfully*. 
Text (.txt) files should be changed to markdown (.md) files
